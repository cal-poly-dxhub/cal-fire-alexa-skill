## Skill Overview
- The [DxHub](https://dxhub.calpoly.edu/challenges/) in partnership with Cal Fire developed a Proof of Concept Alexa SKill
that will allow users get updated information about emerging fires that may be located near you. The skill will provide timely information about the distance and size of fires located near the address where the Alexa device is located or can also take advantage of your current location on the Alexa mobile app should you be out. In addition it can respond to questions about Wildfire Prepardness Week and provide fire prevention information.

- This Alexa Skill was built using the [Alexa Skills Kit](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-skills-kit).

### Known Bugs/Concerns
